<h1>Password Generator</h1><br>
<h3>Password generator that asks the user for the length of the password, a name, and then saves both in a text document.</h3>
<h3>Randomly selects printable (visible) characters.</h3>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>!"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~</p><br>
<h3>Checks the strength of the generated password and tells the user if it is strong or recommends generating a new one with more characters.</h3>
<h3>Remember that there is no more secure password than caution!</h3>
<h3>Keep your passwords in a safe place.</h3>
